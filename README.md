# Boxing
Boxing is a mod that expands on the piling formula some other mods use.
Instead of using blueprints it uses custom interaction in inspect menu.
And Unlike blueprints condition is preserved, meaning food will not magically gain contition.

## However, this mod does not add any piled items on it's own,
Base config file has [ItemPiles](https://github.com/Thekillergreece/FoodPackByTKG) and [FoodPackByTKG](https://github.com/Atlas-Lumi/ItemPiles) as examples
